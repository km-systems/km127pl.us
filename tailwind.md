## tips
### layout
- don't use `h-screen`, use `min-h-screen` instead as that is better for mobile devices.
- when using spacing, stick to the same value, or multiples, e.g. `6` → `12` → `18` → 24 etc.

### colorspace
- if a box/container is big, it's generally ok to use `border` instead of `ring`, as `ring` shines well on small objects (such as `buttons`, `badges`, et cetera)
- if you use one color scheme (e.g. `neutral`), stick to it, it'll look weird otherwise.
